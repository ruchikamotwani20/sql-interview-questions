## ❗ Note on Unsolved Questions

Some SQL questions listed in the accompanying Excel file require a premium subscription to DataLemur for full access to the problem description.

Since I currently do not have access to the premium content, I’ve been unable to solve the following questions:

- Q25, Q28, Q29, Q30, Q31, Q32, Q34, Q37, Q39, Q40, Q41, Q42, Q44, Q46, Q47, Q49, Q50, Q52, Q53, Q55, Q56, Q58, Q59

Once access is available, I will update this repository with solutions for those as well.
