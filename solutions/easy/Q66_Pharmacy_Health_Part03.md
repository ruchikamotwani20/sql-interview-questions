## üßæ Table ‚Äì `pharmacy_sales`

| manufacturer     | drug_name  | total_sales |
|------------------|------------|-------------|
| PharmaCorp       | MedA       | 50000000    |
| HealthMed Inc.   | MedB       | 20000000    |

## üîç Solution ‚Äì Aggregate and Format in Millions

```sql
SELECT 
  manufacturer,
  CONCAT('$', ROUND(SUM(total_sales) / 1000000), ' million') AS sale 
FROM pharmacy_sales
GROUP BY manufacturer
ORDER BY SUM(total_sales) DESC, manufacturer ASC;
```
üí° Explanation

- SUM(total_sales) computes total sales for each manufacturer.

- Divide by 1,000,000 and wrap with ROUND() to get a clean million-format.

- CONCAT() adds the dollar sign and "million" label.

- Sort by total sales (desc) and name (asc) to meet business formatting needs.
