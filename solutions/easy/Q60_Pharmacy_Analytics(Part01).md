**`total_sales - cogs`**

---

## üßæ Table ‚Äì `pharmacy_sales`

| drug         | total_sales | cogs   |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Aspirin      | 50000       | 30000  |
| Ibuprofen    | 60000       | 25000  |

## üîç Solution ‚Äì Calculate Profit and Sort

```sql
SELECT 
  drug, 
  (total_sales - cogs) AS total_proft
FROM pharmacy_sales
ORDER BY (total_sales - cogs) DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

üí° Explanation

total_sales - cogs gives the profit.

We order by profit in descending order.

Use LIMIT 3 to get the top 3 most profitable drugs.
