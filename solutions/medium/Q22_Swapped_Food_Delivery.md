# Q22 ‚Äì Swapped Food Delivery  
**Source:** Zomato  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

---

## ‚úÖ Goal  
You're given a table:

- `orders`: contains `order_id` and the `item` delivered.

Due to a system error, each item's order was **swapped with the next one**.  
Your task is to:  
> Fix the swapped order IDs and return the **correct pairing** of `order_id` and `item`.  
> If the last order has an **odd order_id**, keep it unchanged.

## üßæ Table

### `orders`

| order_id | item             |
|----------|------------------|
| 1        | Chow Mein        |
| 2        | Pizza            |
| 3        | Pad Thai         |
| 4        | Butter Chicken   |
| 5        | Eggrolls         |
| 6        | Burger           |
| 7        | Tandoori Chicken |

## üîç Solution ‚Äì Using CASE and Swapping Logic

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN (order_id = (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM orders)) AND order_id % 2 != 0 THEN order_id
    WHEN order_id % 2 = 0 THEN order_id - 1
    ELSE order_id + 1
  END AS corrected_order_id,
  item
FROM orders
ORDER BY corrected_order_id;
```
üí° Explanation

1Ô∏è‚É£ order_id % 2 != 0 means it's an odd number (like 1, 3, 5, etc.)

2Ô∏è‚É£ If it‚Äôs the last row and odd, don‚Äôt change it

3Ô∏è‚É£ For other odd numbers, swap with the next order (order_id + 1)

4Ô∏è‚É£ For even numbers, swap with the previous order (order_id - 1)

5Ô∏è‚É£ ORDER BY corrected_order_id gives the final fixed sequence
